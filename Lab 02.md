## Part 2 - Bits of permissions
-Command: chmod u+r bubbles.txt
     meaning: chmod command means to change the level  of interaction that the user has with the bubble.txt file, the u+r makes it so the user can read the file. It does not affect anyone else but that user.
     Assessment: Pretty safe command giving the user the ability to read the bubble.txt file.without the file being overly expossed.
